# FileComparer
This is an assignment from the unit Software Engineering Concepts

This program is intended to take a directory and compare all files within that directory (Without duplicate comparisons)
and perform the follwing tasks:

- Append all results to a file named "results.csv".
- For all high similarity results, show files in question to the user in UI
- High similarity is defined as a score of higher than 0.5

Additional conditions include required usage of thread pools and blocking queues to perform tasks efficiently and communicate effectively.
